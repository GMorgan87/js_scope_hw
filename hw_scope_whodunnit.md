# Scope Homework: Who Dunnit

### Learning Objectives

- Understand function scope
- Know the difference in between the let and const keywords

## Brief

Using your knowledge about scope and variable declarations in JavaScript, look at the following code snippets and predict what the output or error will be and why. Copy the following episodes into a JavaScript file and add comments under each one detailing the reason for your predicted output.

### MVP

#### Episode 1

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Library',
  weapon: 'Rope'
};

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${scenario.murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

// Will output "The murderer is Miss Scatlet" because all the scenario consts are accessible by declareMurderer

#### Episode 2

```js
const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);

```
// will return "the murderer is Mrs. Peacock" because all consts are declared in global scope



#### Episode 3

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const declareMurderer = function() {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();
console.log('First Verdict: ', firstVerdict);

const secondVerdict = `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);
```
// firstVerdict will show the murderer because it is calling the function declareMurderer which contains the assignment of the murderer variable and returns the murderers name in a string.
sedondVerdict will error becasue it doest have access to the murderer variable.

#### Episode 4

```js
let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
}

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);
```

//console.log(suspects); will return the list of suspects with Mrs Peacock replaced with Colonel Mustard because the function reassings suspectThree.
//console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`) will return "Suspect three is Mrs Peacock" because the suspectThree is only reassigned within the declareAllSuspects function.


#### Episode 5

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Kitchen',
  weapon: 'Candle Stick'
};

const changeWeapon = function(newWeapon) {
  scenario.weapon = newWeapon;
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is the ${scenario.weapon}.`;
}

changeWeapon('Revolver');
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```
//will return "the weapon is the revolver" because the const variable still allows data within an object to change. it is mutable.

#### Episode 6

```js
let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    murderer = 'Mrs. White';
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function () {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
//will return "The murderer is Mrs White" because changeMurderer reassigns the murderer to 'Mr Green' the calls the plotTwist function which reassigns it again to "Mrs White". Also it is declared in the global scope

#### Episode 7

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

    const unexpectedOutcome = function() {
      murderer = 'Miss Scarlet';
    }

    unexpectedOutcome();
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

//Will return "the murderer is Mrs Scarlet" because the functions reassign the murderer variable then call a nested function which reassigns again. unexpectedOutcome is the last change of the variable.

#### Episode 8

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Mrs. Peacock',
  room: 'Conservatory',
  weapon: 'Lead Pipe'
};

const changeScenario = function() {
  scenario.murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  scenario.room = 'Dining Room';

  const plotTwist = function(room) {
    if (scenario.room === room) {
      scenario.murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';
    }

    const unexpectedOutcome = function(murderer) {
      if (scenario.murderer === murderer) {
        scenario.weapon = 'Candle Stick';
      }
    }

    unexpectedOutcome('Colonel Mustard');
  }

  plotTwist('Dining Room');
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is ${scenario.weapon}.`
}

changeScenario();
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```
// Will return "the weapon is Candle Stick" because the variables are  declared and re-assigned within the global scope

#### Episode 9

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

if (murderer === 'Professor Plum') {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
//Will return "The murderer is Professor Plum" because the murderer is only reassigned to 'Mrs Peacock' within the scope of the if statement.
